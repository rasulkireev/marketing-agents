## Comments
- Add comments only to complex code that requires explanation
- Comments should answer "why" questions rather than describing what the code does
- Focus on explaining the reasoning behind implementation choices, business rules, or non-obvious design decisions
- Avoid redundant comments that simply restate what is already clear from the code itself
