Use this rule whenever you are writing html, css, or even styles in Stimulus controllers that use D3.js.

The codebase uses TailwindCSS v3.x with no custom design system defined.

- Always generate semantic HTML
- Never create new styles without explicitly receiving permission to do so
- Always favor the "utility first" Tailwind approach.  Reusable style classes should not be created often.  Code should be reused primarily through template components.
